Added GUI to control the breathing effect when first started, for when I am not gaming but want some lights

Clicking on one of the RGB buttons will start that effect.

Clicking on disconnect will close the current port so that the GSI server port can be opened to start gaming.

Clicking on exit will close the port and exit the GUI.

Buttons will be disabled for various states of the GUI.
